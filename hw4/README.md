# CAPP 30254 HW4
## Files
- `pipeline.py`: main codes of the functions for this homework
- `run_pipeline.py`: python file to run the functions in `pipeline.py`
- `writeup.ipynb`: writeup for the detailed analysis of the results
- `Analysis Report.pdf`: analytical report of the performances of different models

## Instruction of Running Codes
To test the code, download the file `projects_2012_2013.csv` in a same folder with other python files, then run:
```
$ python3 run_pipeline.py
```
Note: the process of running the pipeline may be very long, all detailed results can be found in `writeup.ipynb`.
