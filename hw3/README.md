# CAPP 30254 HW3
- `pipeline.py`: main codes of the functions for this homework
- `run_pipeline.py`: python file to run the functions in `pipeline.py`
- `classifiers.py`: python file for building models
- `writeup.ipynb`: writeup for the detailed analysis of the results
- `Analysis Report.pdf`: analytical report of the performances of different models

To test the code, simply store the file `run_pipeline.py` and the file `projects_2012_2013.csv` in a same directory, then run:
```
$ python3 run_pipeline.py
```
